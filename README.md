## Why it Exists

Never having enough time for my hobbies - namely gaming, playing around with VR, and learning Japanese, I finally decided to optimise my free time, and combine them into one big hobby. JLPT Dojo is the fusion of all three: a VR game dedicated to the learning of Japanese!

## Roadmap

- [x] Have a target with Kanji of specific JLPT levels.
- [x] Have multiple targets with the right answer, and random other answers.
- [x] Let the player shoot the targets.
- [x] Implement VR support.
- [ ] Let the player specify JLPT levels.
- [ ] Have support for learning Hiragana and Katakana.
- [ ] Have support for learning vocabulary.
- [ ] Have support for learning grammar.
- [ ] Have support for preparing for the Audio section of the JLPT.
- [ ] Implement SRS mechanics.
- [ ] Integrate Text-to-Speech to read the right answer out loud.

## Version History
